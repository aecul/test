    <h2>Personal Biography</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Chanhassen, MN as the oldest of six children. For K-5th grade, I attended Calvin Christian School in Edina, where I made many lifelong friends. In middle and high school, I went to the classical charter school Eagle Ridge Academy in Eden Prairie where I developed a love of literature and art. I graduated in 2013 with about 22 other seniors (a small class, I know!) and then started a four-year bachelor's degree program studying English and Art at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. My (many and varied) dreams for the future include the possibilities of: teaching English in Asia, opening a boarding school, working as an art director at a publishing house, becoming a creative writing or art teacher at a community college, freelance editing or illustrating, or becoming a film critic. In my spare time, I love watching sitcoms like <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> and <i>Parks and Rec</i>. A current goal of mine is learning to cook--even though I hate it. ^^'</p>

    <h2>Professional Biography</h2>
      <p>In the fall of my sophomore year at the U, I took the graduate-level Intro to Editing class in the English department. In January of 2015, I edited the full manuscript of Spencer Wolf's debut novel <i>After Mind.</i> That spring, I was an intern at the <b>Minnesota Literacy Council,</b> where I worked on the literary journal <i>Journeys.</i> This journal compiles works written by adult English and GED students from around Minnesota. I am currently a Publishing Intern at the <b>University of Minnesota Press.</b> My goal there is to learn about the editorial, production, and marketing departments through hands-on projects and tasks.</p>
